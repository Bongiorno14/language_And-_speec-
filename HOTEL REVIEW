Having had several good trips to this hotel before we were excited to return.

We arrived after our long flight from London to check in and at the front desk were told that the room category we booked wasn’t available and we were offered a room we didn’t want. Twin beds instead of a king. After a long period of awkwardness whilst they made several phone calls we were taken to our room. We went to take a shower and had no hot water. We called the front desk and were told that there were 500 other guests in the hotel which is why we weren’t getting hot water. I explained that the hotel should as a basic be able to allow guests to take a shower in their room. They sent maintenance out to us, who advised us we needed to run both the sink taps to trigger hot water. So everyone we want to take a shower, we have to run several taps first to allow the shower water to be hot.

I would expect a guest to receive hot water from the shower when spending almost $2000 per night on a room.

Sadly our fond memories of the One Hotel have diminished. We will stay somewhere else next time, despite having such good trips here in the past.
